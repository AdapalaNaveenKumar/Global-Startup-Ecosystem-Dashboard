## More Detailed Insights:

## High Performers:

‚û°Ô∏è San Francisco not only has the highest Development Score (90) but also leads in both Capital Raised ($427.6B) and Exit Value ($766.3B). This indicates a mature and highly lucrative startup ecosystem, driven by substantial investments and successful exits.

# Investment Concentration:

‚û°Ô∏è The top five cities (San Francisco, New York, Beijing, Shanghai, Los Angeles) collectively raised over $1 trillion in capital. This concentration of investment highlights these cities as pivotal hubs in the global startup ecosystem.


## Regional Leaders:

‚û°Ô∏è North America: San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, and Boston dominate, showcasing the region's robust support for startups through ample funding and a high volume of deals.

‚û°Ô∏è Asia: Beijing and Shanghai lead in capital raised and exit values, with Shenzhen emerging as a significant player with a Development Score of 63 and an impressive Exit Value ($66.3B) relative to its capital raised.

‚û°Ô∏è Europe: London stands out with the highest Deal Count (11,533) in the region, indicating a vibrant startup scene despite having a lower Exit Value ($71.9B) compared to its US and Asian counterparts.

‚û°Ô∏è Middle East: Tel Aviv is notable for its high Development Score (51) and substantial exit value ($32.2B), reflecting a thriving tech ecosystem despite its smaller size.
